# python how to check cupy is installed correctly and working

**Source**: Google search _AI Overview_

To verify if CuPy is installed correctly and functioning, you can perform a
series of checks and run a simple test script.

## Check CuPy Installation and CUDA Version

- Verify CuPy package: Ensure the correct CuPy package (e.g., cupy-cudaXX
where XX matches your CUDA version) is installed and no conflicting cupy
package exists.

```sh
pip freeze | grep cupy
```

â€¢ Confirm CUDA availability: CuPy requires a compatible CUDA installation. You can check your CUDA version and ensure it aligns with the CuPy package you installed.

```sh
nvcc -V
nvidia-smi
```

## Basic Functionality Test

Import CuPy and check version.

```py
import cupy as cp
print(cp.__version__)
```

If this runs without an ImportError, it indicates that the basic CuPy package is accessible.

### Perform a simple GPU operation: This verifies that CuPy can interact with your GPU

```py
import cupy as cp

try:
    # Create a CuPy array on the GPU
    a_gpu = cp.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    print("CuPy array created on GPU:", a_gpu)

    # Perform a simple operation
    b_gpu = a_gpu * 2
    print("Result of GPU operation:", b_gpu)

    # Check the device of the array
    print("Array device:", a_gpu.device)

    # Get the number of available CUDA devices
    num_devices = cp.cuda.runtime.getDeviceCount()
    print("Number of available CUDA devices:", num_devices)

    if num_devices > 0:
        print("CuPy is installed correctly and working with your GPU.")
    else:
        print("CuPy is installed, but no CUDA devices were found.")

except cp.cuda.runtime.CudaError as e:
    print(f"CuPy encountered a CUDA error: {e}")
    print("This might indicate an issue with your CUDA installation or driver.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    print("This might indicate a more general installation issue.")
```

> **Explanation**:

- The script attempts to create a CuPy array, perform a basic arithmetic
operation on it, and then checks the device it resides on.
- It also tries to retrieve the number of available CUDA devices, which
confirms communication with the GPU.
- Error handling is included to catch potential CudaError exceptions, which can
indicate problems with the CUDA installation or drivers, and general
exceptions for other issues.

By successfully running these steps, you can confidently determine if CuPy is
correctly installed and operational within your Python environment and with
your GPU.
